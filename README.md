# Oolon Keyboard
A hacked version of the Lintilla keyboard https://github.com/ctranstrum/lintilla by chad@transtrum.net

Key differences (hehehe):
* layout changed to 233332+3 (from 1+233333+3) so your side-stretches are a bit easier
* layout squared up (hence Lintilla -> Oolon)

(just hacking away at this stage and don't really know what I'm doing!!)
