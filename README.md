# Oolon Keyboard
A hacked version of the Lintilla keyboard https://github.com/ctranstrum/lintilla by chad@transtrum.net

NB: Most of the files are just forked straight from the Lintilla repo, basically the only thing I've changed so far is the Ergogen config file and this README.

Key differences (hehehe):
* layout changed to 233332+3 (from 1+233333+3) so your side-stretches are a bit easier
* layout squared up (hence Lintilla -> Oolon)
* choc spacing (18x17)

(just hacking away at this stage and don't really know what I'm doing!!)

The motivation behind this design is to bring each finger's keys (almost) within 1U of their home key. I *hate* the up and right reaches to the inner and outer columms .. but I don't wan't to lose those colunms completely. This pic as an attempt to illustrate what I mean:

Dramatizing a bit ...
